	+ Nothing new, just recompile/fix for 1.0
* 2015-0420: 0.1 (Ziw) for KSP 0.9
	+ Sequencer
	+ Initial Release of the first official add-on to [Infernal Robotics v0.20](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116064)
	+ This mod will NOT work without the latest version of Infernal Robotics.
	+ What it does?
	+ This add-on serves as a first example of using IR's new [API](https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/wiki/Using-the-IR-API). With this mod you can create and play sequences made of servo movement commands and special commands, like Goto, Toggle ActionGroup, Delay and Wait.
	+ For some more examples inspiration see the forum post.
	+ This mod would not have been possible without invaluable help from Zodius & erendrake.
